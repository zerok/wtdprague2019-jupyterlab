# WriteTheDocs Prague 2019: JupyterLab

This repository contains the slide, code, and data for a lighting talk
at WriteTheDocs Prague 2019 about reproducible documentation using
JupyterLab.

```
$ pipenv sync
$ pipenv run jupyter lab
```

Sadly, that talk didn't actually happen, but I had already prepared
this, so there you go 🙂
